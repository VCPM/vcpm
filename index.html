        <h2>What?</h2>
        <p>Product Hour is a free one-hour workshop with your product team and 1-2 of our experienced product managers (PMs). Our PMs are presently working or used to work in Product Management Roles at various successful startups and top tech companies (Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Amazon). We’ll help you tackle whatever is keeping you up at night - from a tricky user onboarding challenge to scaling your product. The minimal outcome of Product Hour is a Value Decomposition Tree<sup>TM</sup> (VDT) for your product. VDT is a measurement framework which describes your users’ value dimensions and corresponding success metrics. It represents a basis for systematic validated learning about how your projects deliver on each value dimension and how important each value dimension is for maximizing user value at any given point in time.</p>
        <h2>Why?</h2>
        <p>We’re developing a new framework for Value Centric Product Management<sup>TM</sup> (VCPM) that helps you make product decisions based on data about which features are most valuable to your users. VCPM helps you systematically apply methods from Lean Startup, Design Thinking and Data Science at the right time to maximize user value. It enables you to efficiently allocate resources by balancing user value and cost of every project, effectively trade off projects based on your product’s life cycle stage and calibrate the overall product strategy based on drivers of incremental user value. Our gain from solving real problems with VCPM in product hours is the continuous calibration of the VCPM framework.</p>
