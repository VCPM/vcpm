        <h1>Product Hour</h1>
        <h2>What?</h2>
        <p>Product Hour is a free one-hour consultation with your product team and 1-2 of our experienced product managers (PMs), who work or used to work at successful startups and top tech companies (Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Amazon). We'll help you tackle whatever is keeping you up at night - from a tricky user onboarding challenge to scaling your product. The minimal outcome is a measurement framework that describes how your features deliver on each dimension in which you product creates user value.</p>
        <h2>Why?</h2>
        <center><p><b>Our vision is to enable data-based, value-centric product management to drive key business metrics sustainably.</b></p></center>
        <p>We're developing a framework for Value Centric Product Management<sup>TM</sup> (VCPM) that helps product managers and entrepreneurs to make product decisions based on data about which features are most valuable to users. VCPM helps you systematically apply methods from Lean Startup, Design Thinking and Data Science at the right time. It enables you to efficiently allocate resources by balancing user value and cost of every project, effectively trade off projects based on your productâ€™s life cycle stage and calibrate the overall product strategy based on drivers of incremental user value.</p>
		<p>No Cost. Totally Confidential. No Strings attached. Anything you share will be be covered by a non-disclosure agreement. Our gain from tackling real product challenges in Product Hours is the continuous calibration of the VCPM framework. If you want to learn more about what services we offer to help building products that rock, that's great! If not, that's fine too. We're confident that you'll find value in the session.
