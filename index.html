        <h1>Value Centric Product Management</h1>
        <h2>Vision</h2>
        <p>Enable data-based, value-centric product management to drive key business metrics sustainably</p>
        <h2>Target Audience</h2>
        <p>Product Managers, Entrepreneurs and Digital Transformation Consultants</p>
        <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
        <p><i>"I'm trying to make decisions about how to improve the product with no data about which features of the product are most valuable to users."</i></p>
        <p>How do  lean startup and validated learning help if you donâ€™t know what you need to learn? What is the value of design thinking if you do not know how to balance different aspects of user value and prioritize features accordingly? VCPM is a framework for systematically generating user value in every step of product management. By providing systematic guidance for product decisions and drawing on concepts from lean startup, design thinking and data science at the right time and place, VCPM helps efficiently build products that maximize incremental user value and are able to drive business metrics sustainably.
