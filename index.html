        <h1>Value Centric Product Management</h1>
        <h2>Vision</h2>
        <p>Enable data-based, value-centric product management to drive key business metrics sustainably</p>
        <h2>Target Audience</h2>
        <p>Product Managers, Entrepreneurs and Digital Transformation Consultants</p>
        <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
        <p><i>"I'm trying to make decisions about how to improve the product with no data about which features of the product are most valuable to users."</i></p>
        <p>While concepts like Lean Startup and Design Thinking provide a solid foundation to succeed in spite of fierce competition and extremely short innovation cycles, they are not sufficient to win. Lean startup is best known for providing a basis for efficient, validated learning and highly iterative product development, which is critical to adapting your product strategy on the go and therefore to staying competitive. Design thinking offers tools for discovering user needs and ideating on creative ways to effectively serve these. However, the key to shipping successful products lies in the art and science of making the right product decisions under uncertainty and constrained resources (aka product management). Not only does this require efficiently allocating resources by balancing user value and cost of every project. It also means effectively trading off projects based on the productâ€™s life cycle stage at any point in time Lastly, continuously evolving and calibrating the overall product strategy to an ever-changing environment is critical to driving incremental user value.
        </p>
        <h2>Value Proposition</h2>
        <p>VCPM is a framework for systematically generating user value in every step of product management. By providing guidance for product decisions and drawing on concepts from lean startup, design thinking and data science at the right time and place, VCPM helps to efficiently build products that maximize incremental user value and are able to drive business metrics sustainably.
